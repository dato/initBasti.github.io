## Hello World!

Finally, after month of delaying this step, I have started a little blog.
I want to create posts on:
- my journey in writing software
- learning about Operating System Design
- Linux Kernel Internals
- Memory Management
- Unix History
- VIM
- my personal development in the pursuit to become more efficient in learning new things.

The goal of this activity is to be quite frank, more of selfish nature, because I believe that by writing posts, I really encourage myself to understand a topic well. 

### How am I?

My name is Sebastian, 28 and quite obsessed with learning new things and solving problems.
I live in germany, in an area called "Altmark" which could be loosely translated as old borderland. As a day job, I currently work as a System Administrator in an Ecommerce company.

### Current setup:

Distro: Open SUSE Tumbelweed
Fav system-programming lang: C
C compiler: gcc
Fav scripting lang: Python
Shell: bash
Terminal: st
