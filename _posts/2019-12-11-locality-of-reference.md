Locality of reference (by Peter J. Denning)
=========================

I recently read ([this](http://denninginstitute.com/pjd/PUBS/CACMcols/cacmJul05.pdf "locality-of-reference") article about the locality of reference and it's discovery, as I feel a very well written text.
This document doesn't only talk about the principle but also about the development of virtual memory.
It goes into some length about the early problems of virtual memory, misleading aproaches to solve them and then highlights the solution.
I found that the connection to the other topics really helped to acknowledge the significance of this discovery.

If you like to read the article, I have also created a memory card set of questions to the text
